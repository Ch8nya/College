    <h1>Design and Analysis of Algorithms: A Deep Dive into Vertex Cover, 3SAT, and Max Clique</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this comprehensive exploration into the fascinating world of algorithm design and analysis. Here, we'll delve into three intriguing topics: Vertex Cover, 3SAT, and Max Clique. We'll explore these concepts in depth, elucidating their significance in computer science and their application in algorithm design and analysis.</p>
    
    <h2>Vertex Cover</h2>
    <p>The Vertex Cover problem is a classical question within computer science, more specifically within computational complexity theory and optimization.</p>
    <p>A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The Vertex Cover problem is to find a vertex cover of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is NP-Complete, meaning it is as hard as the hardest problems in NP, a class of problems for which a solution can be verified quickly but no efficient solution is known.</p>

    <h2>3SAT</h2>
    <p>The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is another fundamental problem in computer science. It pertains to determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula, in other words, makes it evaluate to true.</p>
    

    <h2>Max Clique</h2>
    <p>In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of the given graph.</p>
